# Detectron2-Mask-Detection
## What is detectron2?
Detectron2 is a ground-up rewrite of Detectron that started with maskrcnn-benchmark. The platform is now implemented in PyTorch. With a new, more modular design, Detectron2 is flexible and extensible, and able to provide fast training on single or multiple GPU servers. It is built by facebook.

## What is in the notebook? 
* Code to train detectron2 to detect is person has wearing a mask or not.
* You can get data which I used to train the detectron2: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
